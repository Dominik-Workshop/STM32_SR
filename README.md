### Projects list and description:
1. **Blink** - sr_lab01:
    - If defined BLINK, LD2 is blinking, else it is toggled
      by pressing B1 or pulling D2 pin (PA10) to ground.
      There is software debouncing on pin D2,
      but not where B1 is connected, because there is
      hardware debouncing (RC circuit) on the NUCLEO board.


2. **Debugging** -sr_lab02:
    - To be continued...
